  ## Summary of the Project 
  This project is a complex backend project that is built with nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, jwt, bcrypt, and many more. This project is a complete backend project that has all the features that a backend project should have. We are building a complete video hosting website similar to youtube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more.

Project uses all standard practices like JWT, bcrypt, access tokens, refresh Tokens and many more. We have spent a lot of time in building this project and we are sure that you will learn a lot from this project.

 
#### Details about some library or features -->

Access tokens and refresh tokens are both components of the OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization protocol, but they serve different purposes in the process.
#### Access Token:
>Purpose: 
An access token is a short-lived token that is used to access protected resources on behalf of a user.
Lifespan:
 Access tokens have a limited lifespan and typically expire after a short duration, often ranging from minutes to hours.
 Usage:
  The client (an application or service) presents the access token to the resource server to gain access to the user's data or perform actions on their behalf.
Security: 
Access tokens should be kept secure, but since they have a short lifespan, even if compromised, the potential damage is limited.
#### Refresh Token:
>Purpose:
 A refresh token is a long-lived token used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
 Lifespan:
  Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan compared to access tokens and are designed to be stored securely.
  Usage:
   When an access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate. This helps to maintain continuous access without prompting the user for credentials again.
Security: 
Because refresh tokens have a longer lifespan and are used to obtain new access tokens, they need to be stored and transmitted securely. If a refresh token is compromised, it poses a greater risk as it can be used to obtain new access tokens.

In summary, access tokens are short-lived and used to access resources, while refresh tokens are long-lived and used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate. The separation of access and refresh tokens enhances security and user experience in OAuth 2.0-based authentication systems.




## bcrypt package
The bcrypt npm package in a JavaScript (Node.js) backend project is commonly used for securely hashing passwords. Below are details about using the bcrypt package:

    Installation:
    You can install the bcrypt package using npm:

    bash

npm install bcrypt

Usage:
In your Node.js backend code, you'll typically use bcrypt to hash passwords during user registration and to check hashed passwords during the login process. Here's a basic example:

javascript

    const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
    const saltRounds = 10; // Number of salt rounds, determines the computational cost

    // Hashing a password
    const plainPassword = 'user_password';
    bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, saltRounds, (err, hash) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error(err);
            return;
        }
        // Store the 'hash' in your database
        console.log('Hashed Password:', hash);
    });

    // Checking a password against its hash
    const enteredPassword = 'user_entered_password';
    const storedHashedPassword = '...'; // Retrieve the hashed password from your database
    bcrypt.compare(enteredPassword, storedHashedPassword, (err, result) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error(err);
            return;
        }
        if (result) {
            console.log('Password is correct');
        } else {
            console.log('Password is incorrect');
        }
    });

Asynchronous Nature:
    Both the hash and compare functions in bcrypt are asynchronous and use callback functions. This is because hashing operations can be computationally expensive, and it's more efficient to handle them asynchronously.

Salt Rounds:
    The saltRounds parameter in the hash function determines the computational cost of the hashing. A higher number of salt rounds increases the time it takes to compute the hash, making it more secure against brute-force attacks. However, it also increases the time needed to hash passwords.

Error Handling:
    Always handle errors appropriately, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations. Check for errors in the callback functions and handle them according to your application's error-handling strategy.

Integration with Database:
    The hashed password should be stored in your database. When verifying passwords during login, retrieve the stored hash from the database and use bcrypt.compare to check if the entered password matches the stored hash.

Using bcrypt helps enhance the security of your application by providing a reliable and widely-used method for securely handling user passwords. Always keep your dependencies up to date and follow best practices for secure password management.

### Mongoose-Aggregate-Pipeline

**
In MongoDB, the aggregation framework allows you to process and transform data documents in a collection. The aggregation pipeline is a series of data processing stages, and Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, provides a convenient way to work with the aggregation pipeline using its aggregate method.

Here's a brief overview of using the Mongoose aggregation pipeline:

>Import Mongoose:
    Make sure to import Mongoose in your Node.js application:
>javascript

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

Define Mongoose Model:
Assume you have a Mongoose model for a collection. For example, let's consider a Person model:

>javascript

const personSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  city: String,
});

const Person = mongoose.model('Person', personSchema);

Aggregation Pipeline:
Use the aggregate method to build and execute the aggregation pipeline. The pipeline consists of various stages, each responsible for a specific operation.

javascript

    // Example aggregation pipeline
    Person.aggregate([
      // Stage 1: Match documents
      {
        $match: {
          city: 'New York',
        },
      },
      // Stage 2: Group by age and calculate average age
      {
        $group: {
          _id: '$age',
          averageAge: { $avg: '$age' },
        },
      },
      // Stage 3: Sort by average age in descending order
      {
        $sort: {
          averageAge: -1,
        },
      },
    ])
      .exec((err, result) => {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err);
          return;
        }
        console.log(result);
      });

    In this example:
        Stage 1 ($match) filters documents where the city is 'New York'.
        Stage 2 ($group) groups documents by age and calculates the average age for each group.
        Stage 3 ($sort) sorts the results by average age in descending order.

Execution:
    The aggregation pipeline is executed using the exec method. The result is passed to a callback function where you can handle errors and process the aggregated data.

_The Mongoose aggregation pipeline allows you to perform complex transformations and computations on your data. You can chain multiple stages to create a powerful pipeline tailored to your specific requirements. Refer to the [official MongoDB documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html) for more details on the aggregation framework and its various stages._
